Hi, I'm Vaibhav Balloli, Research Fellow at Microsoft Research. I hope you crawl around the web of posts and find something interesting or fun you didn't know about. If you find this interesting, you can find some of my non-technical writing at [vballoli.com](vballoli.com) or get to know me more by visiting my [website](vballoli.github.io)
